Pars Scythiam, et rapidum Cretae veniemus-Oaxen,
Et penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos.
En unquam patrios longo post tempore fines,
Pauperis et tuguri congestum cespite culmen,
Post aliquot, mee mgna videns, mirabor aristes? 70
Impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit?
Barbarus has segetes? En quo discordia cives
Perdnxit miseros! en quis consevimus agros!
Insere nunc, Mehboee, pyros, poue ordine vites:
Ite mea, felix quondam pecus, ite capellis, 75
Non ego vos posthac, viridi projectus in antro,
Dumoso pendere procul de rupe videbo ς

Florentem cytisum et salices carpetis amaras.
