GEORG. hill. lv. toa

Omnibus una quies operum, labor omnibus unus.

Mane ruunt portis 3 nusquam morat mrum easdem 185
Vesper ubi e pastu tandem decedere-campis =
Admonuit, tum tecta petunt, tam corpora curant.

In noctem, lassosque sopor suus occupat arbas. 190

Longius, aut credunt caelo adventantibus Burin

Sed circum tntae sub moenibus urbis aquantur,
Excursnsque breves tentant, et saepe lapillos,

Ut cymba instabiles fluctu jactante saburram, 195
Tollunt: his sese per inania nubila librant.
